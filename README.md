This is an update for the right click lib , working with last stable release of fullcalendar.

# fullcalendar-rightclick.js

This small file adds two new callbacks to FullCalendar:

    dayRightclick(date, jsEvent, view)
    eventRightclick(event, jsEvent, view)

To use the file, include it *after* `fullcalendar.js`:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="fullcalendar.js">
    <script type="text/javascript" src="fullcalendar-rightclick.js">

You can then define the callbacks in FullCalendar's options dictionary:

    $('#calendar').fullCalendar({
        dayRightclick: function(date, jsEvent, view) {
            alert('a day has been rightclicked!');
            // Prevent browser context menu:
            return false;
        },
        eventRightclick: function(event, jsEvent, view) {
        	alert('an event has been rightclicked!');
            // Prevent browser context menu:
            return false;
        }
    });

The script is known to work with FullCalendar versions 2.3.1 - 2.6.1 but is likely to also work with later versions.

## Contributing
When you submit a pull request, please make sure that the plugin still works with *each* FullCalendar version >= 2.3.1 ie. test it with 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.4.0, ... . The `demo.html` page in the repository makes testing very easy. Finally, please follow the same coding conventions as in the existing code, in particular the use of tabs instead of spaces.
